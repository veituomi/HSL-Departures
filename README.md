HSL-Departures
==============

This is a simple front-end solution for showing departures from selected stops written in TypeScript.

The purpose of this project was to make a similar experience after the solution [HSL](https://www.hsl.fi/) provided had a few days without proper functioning. Thus the appearance is ripped off the original solution. No copyright infringement is intended.
